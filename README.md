# AutoCompleteTextViewCustomLayoutExample
Added changes for Auto complete text view custom layout example


In this practical we are going to build an AutoCompleteTextView with a custom adapter, that can not only show text suggestions, but also images. 
We will prepare our Java class that will contain the information for each suggestion 
(the name and the image resource) and lastly we will create an custom adapter which will fill these items.
